# Projects
**Japanese Kana CNN:** a convolutional neural network that is able to classify handwritten Japanese kana images with around a 92% accuracy.<br />
**Technical Assignment:** a technical assignment performed for a potential internship position. Within this assignment, I fine-tuned Google's T5 model to perform text summarization using a dataset of news article body and summary texts.<br />
**XOR Gate:** a short application of the XOR gate problem using a simple neural network.<br />
**Second Order Markov:** a simple implentation of a second order markov model utilizing data provided in class.<br />
**Dataset Manipulation Visualization:** a short project showing manipulation of a dataset regarding suicide rates with visual outputs
